``` 

Done.
It executes the following tasks:
- run the Hyperledger network
- deploy chaincode contracts
- start the nerves server
- start the webapp
- run the bootstrap

### Hot Chaincode Contract Upgrade

Assuming you made modifications on the `user` chaincode contracts (User, Keypair or another contract of this organ), and you want it to be deployed to the Network, run:

```bash
$ yarn run upgrade-organ user
``` 

The newly deployed contract will be automatically used by the the organism.

$ docker logs -f <containerId>
```
